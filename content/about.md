Hi!

I am Kim-Adeline Miguel (she/her), and this is the about page for my blog.

💼 As for my day job, I am currently a software engineer at Microsoft on the [Python extension for VS Code](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-python).

🌌 Here are other corners of the internet where you can find me:

Hope you have a great rest of your day 🍵
